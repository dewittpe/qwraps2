#' # mtcars2
#'
#' The base R package datasets provides the mtcars data set.  The information in
#' mtcars is the fuel consumption and automobile characteristics of
{{ nrow(mtcars) }}
#' automobiles as reported in the March, April, June and July 1974 issues of
#' _Motor Trend_ magazine [@hocking1976biometrics].
#'
#' That dataset is modified and extended to provide support for examples within
#' the qwraps2 package documentation.  This vignette documents the construction
#' of mtcars2.
#'
#' # Construction of mtcars2
#'
#' Starting with the original mtcars:
mtcars2 <- mtcars
str(mtcars2)

#'
#' The cyl column provides the number of cylinders for in the engine of the
#' automobiles.  We will use two additional versions of this information, one as
#' character column and one as a factor.  Please note that the order of the
#' factor levels is intentionally set to be non-sequential.  This will help to
#' illustrate the ordering or results when using a factor or a character vector
#' as a grouping variable.
mtcars2$cyl_character <- paste(mtcars2$cyl, "cylinders")
mtcars2$cyl_factor    <- factor(mtcars2$cyl,
                                levels = c(6, 4, 8),
                                labels = paste( c(6, 4, 8), "cylinders"))

#'
#' Create other factor variables.
mtcars2$gear_factor <-
  factor(mtcars2$gear, levels = c(3, 4, 5), labels = paste(c(3, 4, 5), "forward gears"))

#'
#' Engine configuration: the
{{ backtick(vs) }}
#' column is an integer vector for indicating
#' V-shaped or straight.  The constructed column engine is a factor the same
#' information as a labeled factor.
mtcars2$engine <-
  factor(mtcars2$vs, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("V-shaped", "straight"))

#'
#' Transmission: the
{{ backtick(am) }}
#' column is an integer vector indicating if the transmission is automatic or
#' manual.  We construct a
{{ backtick(transmission) }}
#' column to provide the same information as a factor.
mtcars2$transmission <-
  factor(mtcars2$am, levels = c(0, 1), labels = c("Automatic", "Manual"))

#'
#' The rownames of the mtcars2 data set provide the make and model of the
#' automobiles.  Here we will create columns for make and model and then omit
#' the rownames.
mtcars2$make  <- sub("^(\\w+)\\s(.+)", "\\1", rownames(mtcars2))
mtcars2$model <- sub("^(\\w+)\\s(.+)", "\\2", rownames(mtcars2))
rownames(mtcars2) <- NULL

#'
#' To have some dates to use in examples we are going to add an mostly
#' arbitrary date column to mtcars2.  Given that the data came from the March
#' through July issues of _Motor Trend_ in 1974, we will create a
{{ backtick(test_date) }}
#' column starting in January 1974 forward with one to three tests per week
#' through May 1974.  This assumes the data is in chronological order of the data.
set.seed(42)
mtcars2$test_date <-
  as.POSIXct("1974-01-03", tz = "GMT") +
  cumsum(sample(c(2, 3, 4, 7) * 3600 * 24, size = nrow(mtcars2), replace = TRUE))

#'
#' Lastly we will order the columns of mtcars2 so similar columns are next to
#' each other.
mtcars2 <-
  mtcars2[, c("make", "model", "mpg", "disp", "hp", "drat", "wt", "qsec",
              "cyl", "cyl_character", "cyl_factor",
              "vs", "engine",
              "am", "transmission",
              "gear", "gear_factor",
              "carb",
              "test_date")]

#'
#' # Summary of mtcars2
#'
#' mtcars2 is a data frame with
{{ nrow(mtcars2) }}
#' observations with
{{ ncol(mtcars2) }}
#' variables.  Some of the variables tell us the same information, but in
#' different formats.

#' # pefr
#'
#' Peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) data is used for examples within the qwraps2
#' package.  The data has been transcribed from [@bland1986statistical].
#'
#'> The sample comprised colleagues and family of J.M.B. chosen to give a wide
#'> range of PEFR but in no way representative of any defined population. Two
#'> measurements were made with a Wright peak flow meter and two with a mini
#'> Wright meter, in random order. All measurements were taken by J.M.B., using
#'> the same two instruments. (These data were collected to demonstrate the
#'> statistical method and provide no evidence on the comparability of these two
#'> instruments.) We did not repeat suspect readings and took a single reading as
#'> our measurement of PEFR. Only the first measurement by each method is used to
#'> illustrate the comparison of methods, the second measurements being used in
#'> the study of repeatability.
#'
#' The units of measure for the pefr are liters per minute (L/min).
