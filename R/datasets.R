#' Peak expiratory flow rate data
#'
#' Peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) data is used for examples within the qwraps2
#' package.  The data has been transcribed from Bland (1986).
#'
#' "The sample comprised colleagues and family of J.M.B. chosen to give a wide
#' range of PEFR but in no way representative of any defined population. Two
#' measurements were made with a Wright peak flow meter and two with a mini
#' Wright meter, in random order. All measurements were taken by J.M.B., using
#' the same two instruments. (These data were collected to demonstrate the
#' statistical method and provide no evidence on the comparability of these two
#' instruments.) We did not repeat suspect readings and took a single reading as
#' our measurement of PEFR. Only the first measurement by each method is used to
#' illustrate the comparison of methods, the second measurements being used in
#' the study of repeatability."
